### Hello! My name is Tina.

Recently I have found my passion for designing and coding for web and mobile. Since then I have started developing my skills through academic and personal projects as well as online courses.

Even with my focus being on the front end side of the development world, I know I have much to learn and plan to get more knowledgeable with every step of the way.
